## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.

- [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - A Predictable State Container for JS Apps

### What I learned

This was my first project where I used Redux for managing application's state. I found it quite useful in terms of sharing application's state between different components.
